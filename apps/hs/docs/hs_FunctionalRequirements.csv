HS1001,HS1001,"Upon receipt of a Reset command, HS shall reset the following housekeeping variables to a value of zero:
a)       Valid Ground Command Counter
b)       Ground Command Rejected Counter.",Important for testing and on-orbit flight operations in order to start with a “clean slate”.
HS1002,HS1002,"For all HS commands, if the length contained in the message header is not equal to the expected length, HS shall reject the command and issue an event message.",Basic command verification in the event of SEU or memory corruption
HS1003,HS1003,"If HS accepts any command as valid, HS shall execute the command, increment the HS Valid Command Counter and issue an event message.",Operators require feedback on command execution.

HS2000,HS2000,The HS Application shall verify that each application defined in the Application Table is executing.,HS uses a table to define monitored applications. Tables are used so that the list can be configured for a mission and can be easily changed.
HS2000.2,HS2000.2,"If the Application has not executed for the corresponding table-defined number of HS execution cycles, HS shall execute one of the table-defined actions:
a) Restart the Failed Application (This action will fail for cFE Core Apps)
b) cFE Processor Reset
c) Send an Event Message
d) Send a Software Bus Message
e)  Perform No Action","Note that each entry has a corresponding HS execution counter which represents the number of HS execution cycles before the Application is  considered failed. An application can have more than one entry (could have one entry to restart the app and a second entry to perform a cFE Processor reset). More than one application restart can be performed in one HS cycle. The Software Bus message can be any message, however, the intent is to allow the starting of an RTS (without tying HS to SC).  cFE ES will reject any attempt to restart a core application, so this combination should not be used."

Note that a value of zero can be used if a mission does not want to include Execution counters.
HS3000.1,HS3000.1,"If the Item contained in the Execution Counter Table is unknown, HS shall set the Execution Counter value for that entry to 0xFFFFFFFF.","Either that application didn’t initialize properly and just exited its run loop or  the table contained an invalid item reference (eg. invalid application, invalid task). Reporting ‘FFFFFFFF’ gives the ground an indication that something isn’t correct."

a) Restart Application that generated the Event
b) Perform cFE Processor Reset
c) Delete the Application that generated the Event
d) Send a Software Bus Message e) Perform No Action","The user defines the action that is appropriate if the critical event is received.  Note that the delete is included in the case where an application might want  to “get fancy” and stop running an application based on some event. Note that LRO allowed for RTSs to be started as one of the actions. CFS does not include this – can be done by LC using tlm and RTSs. Note that the Software  Bus message can be any message, however, the intent it to allow the starting  of an RTS (without tying HS to SC)."
