Summary,Custom field (Requirement ID),Description,Custom field (Requirement Rationale)
FM1000,FM1000,"Upon receipt of a No-Op command, FM shall increment the Valid Command Counter and generate an event message.",Debug command to verify application is alive
FM1001,FM1001,"Upon receipt of a Reset Counters command,  FM shall reset the following housekeeping variables to a value of zero:      
a) Valid Command Counter(s)
b) Command Rejected Counter(s)","Important for testing and on-orbit in order to start with a “clean slate”.  Note for implementations where commands are processed in different contexts (tasks) and have separate counters, they all need to be reset."
FM1002,FM1002,"If the computed length of any FM command is not equal to the length contained in the message header, FM shall reject the command",Basic command verification in the event of SEU or memory corruption
FM1003,FM1003,"If FM accepts any command as valid, FM shall execute the command, increment the FM Valid Command Counter and issue an event message","Operators require positive feedback from successful commands.  Note for implementations where commands are processed in different contexts (tasks), the command may be accepted in one context but rejected in another.  For example a main task could except a command, increment it's valid command counter, pass the command to a child task, which then could reject the command and increment it's invalid command counter.  These behavior details are implementation/design specific but still meet the intent of the requirement."
FM1004,FM1004,"If FM rejects any command, FM shall abort the command execution, increment the FM Command Rejected Counter and issue an error event message","Operators require notification of command failures.  Note for implementations where commands are processed in different contexts (tasks), the command may be accepted in one context but rejected in another.  For example a main task could except a command, increment it's valid command counter, pass the command to a child task, which then could reject the command and increment it's invalid command counter.  These behavior details are implementation/design specific but still meet the intent of the requirement."
FM1005,FM1005,"If the filename specified in any FM command is not valid, FM shall reject the command",If the filename is not valid then want to reject the command. Non-fully qualified filenames will be considered invalid.
FM1006,FM1006,"If the directory specified in any FM command is not valid, FM shall reject the command",If an invalid directory is specified than want to reject the command
FM1008,FM1008,The CFS FM FSW shall utilize full path specifications having a maximum length of <PLATFORM_DEFINED> characters for all command input arguments requiring a file or pathname.,Fully qualified filenames or paths help ensure the correct files/directories are being manipulated.

FM2005,FM2005,"Upon receipt of a Rename command, FM shall rename the command-specified file to the command-specified destination file.","Rename can work faster than move command because the entire contents of the file don't need to be moved, only the name gets changed. If there happens to be a situation where memory was very low, the move command may not be possible due to the fact that a new source file is created before the old one is deleted."

a) the number of open files  
b) Up to <PLATFORM_DEFINED> names/paths (of each open file) and the application name that has opened the file","Provides operators info about open files - Files that are open should not be deleted or downlinked. If too many files are open at once, the system could run slower than expected, or decline another file from being opened. Note that the <MISSION_DEFINED> limit is imposed in support of fixed size telemetry messages."

The command specified offset is used
since there is a maximum number of files that can be downlinked (offset into
the file list). Note that the modification time format is specified by a cFE configuration parameter (TAI or UTC)"
