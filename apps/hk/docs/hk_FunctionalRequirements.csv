Summary,Custom field (Requirement ID),Description,Custom field (Requirement Rationale)
HK1000,HK1000,"Upon receipt of a No-Op command, HK shall increment the HK Valid Command Counter and generate an event message.",Debug command to verify application is alive.
HK1001,HK1001,"Upon receipt of a Reset command, HK shall reset the following housekeeping variables to a value of zero:
a) HK Valid Command Counter
b) HK Command Rejected Counter
c) Number of Output Messages Sent
d) Missing Data Counter",Important for testing and on-orbit flight operations in order to start with a “clean slate”
HK1002,HK1002,"For all HK commands, if the length contained in the message header is not equal to the expected length, HK shall reject the command.",Basic command verification in the event of SEU or memory corruption.
HK1003,HK1003,"If HK accepts any command as valid, HK shall execute the command, increment the HK Valid Command Counter and issue an event message",Provides basic verification of each HK command (i.e. HK command parameters are acceptable)
HK1004,HK1004,"If HK rejects any command, HK shall abort the command execution, increment the HK Command Rejected Counter and issue an error event message",Provides indicator of erroneous command
HK2000,HK2000,HK shall collect flight software housekeeping data from table-specified input messages,Use of tables makes it easier to modify/maintain
HK2000.1,HK2000.1,"If the HK Copy Table fails validation, HK shall issue an event message.",This is the case when the total memory stored in the combined copy packet is greater than the <PLATFORM_DEFINED> allowable size.
HK2001,HK2001,"HK shall output table-defined messages, at the scheduled rate, by combining input message data starting at the table-defined offset and table-defined number of bytes to the table-defined offset in the output message.",Useful to group telemetry from multiple apps into a single message
HK2001.1,HK2001.1,"Upon a table update, HK shall update the output message formats specified in the table during normal execution.",Supports the capability to adding and removing applications at runtime (or modifying messages)
HK2001.2,HK2001.2,"If the <PLATFORM_DEFINED> parameter Discard Combo Packets is set to NO and HK does not receive a message from an application, HK shall use all values associated with last received message for that application in the combined message for that telemetry collection period.",Zeroing data could have undesirable effects.
HK2001.3,HK2001.3,"If HK does not receive a message from an application, HK app shall increment the missing data counter and send an event specifying  the message ID for the missing message",Important to inform the ground of any failure detection. 
HK2001.5,HK2001.5,If the <PLATFORM_DEFINED> parameter Discard Combo Packets is set to NO and the input message offset + bytes for any input message specified in the HK table is greater than the received message length then HK shall use the last received data associated with that message and issue no more than one event message per input message.,Prevents reading past the end of message (If there is an error in the HK table where the offset + bytes for a specific message exceeds the total message length)
HK2001.6,HK2001.6,"If the <PLATFORM_DEFINED> parameter Discard Combo Packets is set to YES and HK does not receive a message from an application, HK shall discard the combined message containing the values associated with the missing application message for that telemetry collection period.",Prevents ground processing of combination packets 
HK2001.7,HK2001.7,If the <PLATFORM_DEFINED> parameter Discard Combo Packets is set to YES and the input message offset + bytes for any input message specified in the HK table is greater than the received message length then HK shall discard the combined message containing the values associated with the illegal length application message for that telemetry collection period.,Prevents reading past the end of message (If there is an error in the HK table where the offset + bytes for a specific message exceeds the total message length).  Prevents ground processing of combination packets containing stale data.
HK3000,HK3000,"HK shall generate a housekeeping message containing the following:
a) Valid Command Counter
b) Command Rejected Counter
c) Number of Output Messages Sent
d) Missing Data Counter",Housekeeping telemetry to indicate basic HK status.
HK4000,HK4000,"Upon initialization of the HK Application, HK shall initialize the following data to Zero
a) Valid Command Counter
b) Command Rejected Counter
c) Number of Output Messages Sent
d) Missing Data Counter",HK does not preserve data across any type of reset
